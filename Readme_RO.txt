Also included: Module Manager (by sarbian, based on ialdabaoth's work). See Module Manager thread for details and license and source: http://http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/55219
Module Manager is required for RO to work.

INSTALL:
1. Install required mods, updating as necessary
2. Remove any existing RealismOverhaul folder in KSP/GameData/ and any existing SFJBRealEngines folder in KSP/GameData/
3. Unzip this archive to KSP/GameData.
========================================

This is a set of ModuleManager tweaks and part rescales for a 100% human-scale KSP.

Requires:
Real Solar System (else why use this?)
Real Fuels v4.1+
Stretchy SRB v8.1+ (or you won't have the right size tanks)
Deadly Reentry v4.2+ (for the heatshields)
Ferram Aerospace Research (made by the amazing ferram4)
RealChutes (by stupid_chris)
Engine Ignitor (by HoneyFox). NOTE: You MUST delete all cfg files in the root EngineIgnitor folder after you install Engine Ignitor.

Best with:
Medieval Nerd's Realistic Tech Progression
Supported parts packs
Procedural Fairings
RemoteTech 2

Supported parts packs:
AIES (Partial support for pods, full support for battery/RTG/solar panels; engines)
KW Rocketry (mostly american and european engines)
NovaPunch (partially, more support coming soon)
Bobcat Soviet engines pack (Soviet/Russian engines)
BT Engine Pack (Merlin 1D)
F-1 Engine replica (need to remove the space from the partName though)
KerbX (for SpaceX engines)
RLA Stockalike alternative models (Shuttle OMS)

Changes:
*New size system: 0.5m, 1m, 2m, 3m, etc.
*Rescales of stock parts and Procedural Fairings to support the new size system.
*Realistic battery and solar panel numbers, and usage for RT2 antennae. 1EC/s = 1kW. Solar panels don't produce much, but they're light.
*RTGs are now modeled after real RTGs.
*DRE Heatshields support RSS, new heatshields added
*Various structural/aero parts had their masses tweaked, including PF large bases. PF lage bases now have tiny decouplers.

Partial support:
Pods: Squad Mk1, Mk1-2, AIES Orbital Pod.
Probes: the Squad probes. AIES probes have electrical charge fixed but neither rescaled nor remassed as yet.
Note that only the two stack probes (now 2m and 3m) have much in the way of torque; even then you'll want to bring RCS. Everything else doesn't have any torque to speak of.
