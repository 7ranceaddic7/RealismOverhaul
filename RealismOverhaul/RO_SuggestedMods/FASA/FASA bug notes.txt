Mercury:

Made Mercury LES stagable, so it behaves like the Apollo LES and is jetissoned on staging

Made Mercury cap attach to the capsule, rather than the parachute

Attached the roll RCS and properly, corrected RCSFX config

Removed stock reaction wheel from Mercury capsule attitude control

Made the parachute attach to the capsule, adding an attachment point to the capsule to support
