Engine Support:
Realism Overhaul comes with the RealEngines set of engine patches (originally by SFJackBauer). It gives engines the stats of real-world engines that look similar, like NovaPunch K2-X -> J-2.
However, it also supports NathanKell's Reaching for the Stars pack, which gives engines "realistic" stats with a real-world flavor without being clones. This is required when using Realistic Tech Progression Lite (RPL).
The RftS Pack can be downloaded from the fourth post here: http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/57833.

Changes:
*New size system: 0.5m, 1m, 1.25m, 1.5m, 2m, 2.5m, 3m, 3.5m, 3.75m, 4m, 5m, 6m, 7m, 8m, 9m, 10m
*Rescales via TweakScale of stock and generic part packs to support the new size system
*Realistic battery and solar panel numbers, and usage for RT2 antennae. 1EC/s = 1kW. Solar panels don't produce much, but they're light.
*RTGs are now modeled after real RTGs
*DRE Heat shields now support RSS, with new heat shields added based on new size system
*Masses tweaked
*Realistic use of Reaction Wheels - very few parts have them, and those that do their forces are limited and RCS would be a good thing.

FAQ:
Q: How do I do X in Real Solar System / RO?
A: Check the RSS Wiki, it may have an answer!

Q: My engines are disappearing into my fueltank!
A: The "going into the fueltank" thing is a trick SFJackBauer devised to get around the issue that most KSP engine models are actually engines + giant fuel tank bottom domes, basically. (Look up pictures of rocket engines. At most they have a turbopump etc at the top, or a set-of-girders thrust structure. Not a giant dome; that's the bottom of the fuel or oxidizer capsule-shaped tank.) Which is bad if you, for instance, want to use the engine on a different-sized fuel tank. Can't do anything about using an engine with a giant dome on a *smaller* tank, but for bigger tanks SFJackBauer devised this system where the unsightly dome is hidden inside the fueltank. Works great for clusters like S-II.

Q: How do I make a controlled, lifting reentry with the Mk1-2 Pod?
A: See this awesome video for a tutorial.
