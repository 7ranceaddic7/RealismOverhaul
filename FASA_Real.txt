Requires the FASA pack from frizzank -- all the parts are by him; I just edited some CFG values. I have his written permission to have done this and post it.

Includes some work by Dragon01

This includes all parts for Gemini and the Titan II GLV in the Gemini-Titan II configuration, the Big Gemini pod, provisional service module, and Titan IIIC launcher (Titan II lower and upper stages, Transtage upper stage, UA1205 SRMs). Will be replaced by real Titan IIIC lower stages and engines soon.

Also includes Mercury and Atlas MALV. Other FASA parts coming soon.

Extract to your KSP folder.

REQUIREMENTS:
FASA 3.3 or above
Real Fuels v4
Deadly Reentry (otherwise your Gemini will be 144kg too light)
Useless without: Real Solar System (who wants a 9.3km/s booster for stock Kerbin?) and thus you also should have FAR.

INSTRUCTIONS:
If launching to 0 inclination, a gauranteed to work MJ ascent path is turn start 1.3km, turn end 110km, end angle 0, turn shape 45. Note that neither the LR-87 nor LR-91 is throttleable. So if you want a lower apoapsis, you have to manually shut down the LR-91 (or set it to an AG in the VAB before launch for easy access).
Electrical charge balanced for 300watt draw. Yields 20 days of power if you use the fuel cell.
Due to not being able to make bipropellant RCS, all the OAMS thrusters (ingame both RCS and engine) use Monopropellant. But don't worry, the Isp and fuel mass is identical to real life. You will be shown > 222m/s dV, but that's because it can draw from the capsule's own supply. Shut that tank off until reentry.

A perigee of 9km is survivable coming from a 360-380km apogee. When you're ready for your 101m/s retro kick, pointo retrograde, and stage to jettison equipment module and activate retro module. Stage again when retro exhausted.
Stay pointed surface-retrograde on reentry. At 15km, stage to deploy the drogue. Drogue will fully deploy at 6.4km. At 3.2km, stage again to jettison nose section and drogue; main chute will semi-deploy. At 2.74km, main deploys.
