Although holding much less gas than its cryogenic counterparts, the lower density helps minimize weight on landers, and helps to keep the workplace occupational hazard department off our backs.

        @description = Contains four individual oxygen canisters under extreme cryogenic pressure. Seperated to ensure redundancy in the unlikely event of explosion from external forces. Combined with a hydrogen tank provides enough fuel to run a 710W fuel cell for almost 9 days, with enough oxygen remaining to keep a kerbonaut alive for 12 days. When used exclusively for breathing, will keep a single kerbonaut alive for 50. Licking the boiloff valve is discouraged.

// From GH #9:

// The elektron was a test. The ISS, 1kg=1L of water is broken down into 25L of O2
// with H2 being dumped overboard every hour. Giving 600L of O2 every day, just
// over the requirement for 1 person...of course the unit is capable of a lot
// more...using 6kg=6L of water and generating 150L of oxygen an hour or 3600L a
// day, enough for 6 people...that's normal operation...max operation is up to 10L
// of water into 250L of oxygen an hour. Since the unit is approximately half
// sized from the real thing, I figure we can halve that normal operation
// capacity...so 3L of water to 75L of oxygen per hour. 72L of water to 1800L of
// O2 per day. Power consumption for the unit is 1kW so half will be 0.5kW.
